# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Network Configuration
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This infrastructure supports both same-project and cross-project Shared VPC
#
# OPTION 1: Same-Project VPC (network and project in same GCP project)
# Use short names or self-links
# network_project_id can be omitted (defaults to project_id)
#
# Example with short names (for default VPC):
# network    = "default"
# subnetwork = "default"
#
# Example with self-links (for custom VPC):
# network    = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/global/networks/YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
# subnetwork = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/YOUR_SUBNET_NAME"
#
# OPTION 2: Cross-Project Shared VPC (network in host project, resources in service project)
# Must use self-link format and specify network_project_id
#
# Example:
# network_project_id = "YOUR_HOST_PROJECT_ID"
# network            = "projects/YOUR_HOST_PROJECT_ID/global/networks/YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
# subnetwork         = "projects/YOUR_HOST_PROJECT_ID/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/YOUR_SUBNET_NAME"
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Subnet must have secondary IP ranges for GKE pods and services
# - For Shared VPC: service project must be attached to host project
# - For Shared VPC: service accounts will be granted compute.networkUser role
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Leave commented out for same-project VPC (defaults to project_id)
# Uncomment and set for cross-project Shared VPC
